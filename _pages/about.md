My name is Sunmook Choi (최선묵).

I am a Ph.D. student in the Center of Applied Mathematics (CAM) at Cornell University, starting from this Fall semester. I received my Master's degree in Mathematics at Korea University under supervision of Professor [Seungsang Oh](https://sites.google.com/view/seungsangoh/home) in August 2024. I also received my Bachelor's degree in Mathematics at Korea University. My research interest broadly lies on theoretical aspects of data science, machine learning, deep learning, and deep reinforcement learning and their applications.

This is my [CV (updated Aug. 2024)](http://smfelixchoi.github.io/files/CV.pdf). Thank you.
